# The Frogge Game: A Peer-to-Peer Survival Economy

## Abstract
This whitepaper introduces The Frogge Game, a unique multiplayer experience that blends survival gameplay, token incentives, and blockchain technology. Our game aims to create an immersive and skillful environment where players compete for cryptocoins while navigating the challenges of an island with competing factions. By leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a peer-to-peer economic model, The Frogge Game offers an innovative approach to NFTs, in-game transactions and player interaction.

## Introduction
The Frogge Game introduces a captivating world set on an archipelago inhabited by two factions: the frogs and the menacing zombie frogs. Players take on the role of either a frog or a zombie frog, engaging in intense competition to catch tokens scattered throughout the map. This whitepaper explores the mechanics and dynamics that underpin The Frogge Game, including the FRGE tokens and in game NFTs.

## Gameplay Mechanics
The gameplay of The Frogge Game revolves around alternating cycles of day and night. During the day, frogs have the advantage, as they can eliminate zombie frogs and collect coins unhindered. Conversely, during the night, the zombie frogs gain the upper hand, targeting vulnerable frogs while continuing their pursuit of coins. The game mechanics emphasize team play, strategic decision-making, survival skills, and resource management.

## Random Distribution of FRGE Tokens
To incentivize player participation, The Frogge Game introduces the concept of Frogge (FRGE) tokens. A fixed supply of 3,000,000 FRGE tokens per supported blockchain is minted for the game, totaling 21,000,000 FRGE tokens across all blockchains. These tokens act as a digital currency within the game ecosystem, incentivizing players, and serving as a measure of player success. The tokens are entered into the game at a fixed rate and randomly distributed across the multiple islands, encouraging players to embark on adventurous sailing journeys to recollect them. The ever increasing number of tokens results in an increasing incentive for players to join the adventure, as more tokens become available. 

## Economic Incentives
The Frogge Game incorporates economic futher incentives to foster engagement. Frog and zombie frog homes, represented by NFTs, serve as safe havens for their respective factions durint their vulnerable time of the day. When seeking refuge in these homes, players are required to pay a fee predetermined by the NFT owner, which is noted on the same coins that the player collects. 80% of the collected fee goes to the owner of the NFT, while 20% is used to develop and maintaint he game. This economic model encourages strategic planning, collaboration, and a dynamic player-driven economy; as well as a sustainable model to upkeep the game development.  There are a total of 88 homes across the virtual world.

### Islands and Sailboats
To enhance gameplay variety and exploration, The Frogge Game introduces 88 islands represented by NFTs. These islands present unique challenges and opportunities for players to earn more coins. Similar to frog and zombie frog homes, players must pay a fee to access these islands, contributing to the economic ecosystem of the game. The fees are paid to the NFT owner, with 20% collected to support game development and maintenance. 

88 Strategically placed boat ports facilitate travel between islands; players pay a fee to use them. 80% of the fee goes to the NFT owner, while 20% supports the game develpopment. However, beware, as there is a one in 10 chance of encountering the dreaded kraken during the journey.

The NFTs create multiple important game economic dynamics. Owners of the NFTs are able to decide the price for the services they provide in the game, such as determining how much a visiting player pays to enter an island or use a sailing port.

It is essential to note that Homes NFTs, Islands NFTs, and Sea Ports NFTs are unique across all supported blockchains, so the fees generated apply to all blockchains. In other words, a fee paid on Polygon or Ethereum will still go to the same NFT owner. There are no per blokchain islands, but a unique set across all blokchains. 

The islands, homes, and sailing ports can be acquired by users who have collected enough FRGE tokens, giving the tokens a use case beyond being a score within the game community. And being able to participate in the game deciding the economics of each NFT.

## Payment and FRGE Conversion
To ensure the integrity of the game and prevent civil attacks, players are required to pay a small fee each time they wish to participate. This payment mechanism serves as a deterrent against unfair behavior, such as civil attacks. The player's payment is instantly converted into FRGE tokens using an automated market maker (AMM) integrated within the game. The acquired FRGE tokens are then randomly distributed across the islands. The AMM provides a seamless and secure way to convert the blockchain currency to FRGE tokens, ensuring transparency and efficiency in the process, while also increasing real-world value to the FRGE coins.

## Special tokens and Inventory
There are 3 special tokens in the game, that provide the player with special abilities. The invisibility token, that turns the player invisible for a few seconds. Other players may then no see the frog, but may see tokens dissapear. The speed token, that allows a player to move faster for a few seconds. And finally the switch side token, that will conver a frog into a zombie frog, or a zombie frog into a regular frog. All these tokens are represented on the blokchain as an erc20 tokens, they are scarce and can be aquiered by the players by swaping the FRGE token they collect to them.

##Game UX
Game graphics are a reminiscence of the early nes and snes tailset based game. It is inspired on famous RPS like Zelda and dragon quest series. While the UX is enjoyable, it does not focus on intensive graphics, but on a more simplistic game style where decision making and resource management play the most important role. The game is desgined to be played on mobile phones, and the UI is reminiscent of the classif portable consoles of the 90s. A cursor lets the frog jump around the map, the A button opens the inventory to select an activate a special ability like insiviliby., and the B button allows to record an audio message that is played in the map, as a way to create a sociable experience. 

## Conclusion
The Frogge Game presents an innovative gaming experience that merges survival gameplay, economic incentives, and blockchain technology. By immersing players in a dynamic environment where skillful gameplay, economic decision-making, and the acquisition of FRGE tokens intertwine, The Frogge Game aims to reshape the gaming landscape. With the support of a vibrant community, continuous development, and player-centric design, The Frogge Game seeks to establish itself as a trailblazer in the gaming industry.
