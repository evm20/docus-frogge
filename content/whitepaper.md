# The Frogge Game: A Peer-to-Peer Survival Economy

**Abstract:**
This whitepaper introduces The Frogge Game, a unique multiplayer experience that blends survival gameplay, economic incentives, and blockchain technology. Our game aims to create an immersive and skillful environment where players compete for cryptocoins while navigating the challenges of an island of frogs and zombie frogs. By leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and a peer-to-peer economic model, The Frogge Game offers an innovative approach to in-game transactions and player interaction. This whitepaper outlines the core concepts and the use of FRGE tokens and NFTs within The Frogge Game.

## Introduction
The Frogge Game introduces a captivating world set on an archipelago inhabited by two factions: the frogs and the menacing zombie frogs. Players take on the role of either a frog or a zombie frog, engaging in intense competition to catch coins scattered throughout the map. This whitepaper explores the mechanics and economic dynamics that underpin The Frogge Game.

## Gameplay Mechanics
The gameplay of The Frogge Game revolves around the alternating cycles of day and night. During the day, frogs have the advantage, as they can eliminate zombie frogs and collect coins unhindered. Conversely, during the night, the zombie frogs gain the upper hand, targeting the vulnerable frogs while continuing their pursuit of coins. The game mechanics emphasize team play, strategic decision-making, survival skills, and resource management.

## Random Distribution of FRGE Tokens
To incentivize player participation, The Frogge Game introduces the concept of Frogge (FRGE) tokens. A total of 3,000,000 FRGE tokens per supported blockchain are minted for the game. These tokens act as a digital currency within the game ecosystem,they incentivise players, and serving as a measure of player success. There will be a total of 7 supported blokchains, for a total of 21,000,000 FRGE tokens across all blokchans.

## Economic Incentives
The Frogge Game incorporates economic incentives to foster engagement. Frog and zombie frog homes, represented by NFTs, serve as safe havens for their respective factions. When seeking refuge in these homes, players are required to pay a fee predetermined by the NFT owner and noted on the same coins that the player collects. This economic model encourages strategic planning, collaboration, and a dynamic player-driven economy. The fees paid go to the owner of the NFT, minus a small fee that funds the development of the game.

### Islands and Sailboats
To enhance gameplay variety and exploration, The Frogge Game introduces additional islands represented by NFTs. These islands present unique challenges and opportunities for players to earn more coins. Similar to frog and zombie frog homes, players must pay a fee to access these islands, contributing to the economic ecosystem of the game.

To facilitate travel between islands, boat ports are strategically placed throughout the map. Just like home and islands, players pay a fee to use these boat ports, allowing them to move seamlessly between different islands and expand their gameplay access. Taking a sail boat is not without risk, there is one in 10 chances, you will be attacked by the cracken in your journey. 

Notice that Homes NFTS, Islands NFTS and Boat Ports NFTS are unique across all supported blokchains, so the fees generated happen for all blokchains. In other words, a fee being paid on EOSEVM or Ethereum, still goes to the same NFT owner.  

## Payment and FRGE Conversion
To ensure the integrity of the game and prevent civil attacks, players are required to pay a small fee each time they wish to participate. This payment mechanism not only adds a nostalgic touch reminiscent of early arcade machines but also serves as a deterrent against unfair behavior, such as civil attacks. The payment by the player is at once converted into FRGE tokens using an automated market maker (AMM) integrated within the game; the aquiered tokens are then randomly distributed across the islands.  The AMM provides a seamless and secure way to convert the blockchain currency to FRGE tokens, ensuring transparency and efficiency in the process, as well as provide real-world value to the FRGE coins.

## Conclusion
The Frogge Game presents an innovative gaming experience that merges survival gameplay, economic incentives, and blockchain technology. By immersing players in a dynamic environment where skillful gameplay, economic decision-making, and the acquisition of FRGE tokens intertwine, The Frogge Game aims to reshape the gaming landscape. With the support of a vibrant community, continuous development, and player-centric design, The Frogge Game seeks to establish itself as a trailblazer in the gaming industry.
